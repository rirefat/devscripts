## Introduction to HTML Tips and Tricks

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of web development, and mastering it can greatly improve your website's structure, accessibility, and performance. Here are 20 tips and tricks to help you get the most out of HTML.

### 1. Use Semantic HTML
Semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>` improve accessibility and SEO by giving your content meaning.

### 2. Optimize Images with the `<picture>` Element
The `<picture>` element allows you to serve different images based on device screen size or resolution, ensuring optimized performance.

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image-large.jpg" media="(min-width: 800px)">
  <img src="image-small.jpg" alt="Sample image">
</picture>
